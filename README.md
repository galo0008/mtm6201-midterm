## Project Description
This project is a 3-page responsive website created using HTML and CSS based on the design prototype **“Nutritionist - Light Theme Healthy Diet Planning Website UI Design Template”** by **Praha**. 

It demonstrates my ability to structure, style, and optimize web pages for multiple screen sizes without using any frameworks such as Bootstrap.
